Welcome to my research website. Here we discuss using multistate models, phenotypic and genotypic dta to model transitions between states.


[Here](Fig1_proportionmap.html) We demonstrate figure 1, the proportional representation.

[Here](Figure3.html) We demonstrate figure 3, the survival, ten year interval risk, remaining lifetime risk and 30 year risk under recalibrated Framingham score

[Here](Figure4.html) We demonstrate figure 4, the performance of MSGene versus the PCE and FRS 30 year score in a thresholding and continuous metric, after using per year predictions in a time dependent cox model.

[Here](Figure5.html) We demonstrate figure 5, ten year risk versus absolute risk reduction, remaining lifetime risk versus absolute risk reduction, and absolute risk reduction versus age of initiation marginalized across states and covariate profiles..
